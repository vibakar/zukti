 is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI
components which present data that changes over time. Lots of people use  as the V in MVC.
react abstracts away the DOM from you, giving a simpler programming model and better performance.
 can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using  Native.Routes route props
 implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.
 uses virtual DOM which is JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance since JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM.
 can be used on client and server side.Component and Data patterns improve readability which helps to maintain larger apps. can be used with other frameworks.
 uses JSX for templating instead of regular JavaScript. It is not necessary to use it, but there are some pros that comes with it.
